Increasing Season length would provide longer timeframes to reach project and guild KPIs and goals, but could reduce flexibility of the DAO as funding access is largely tied to seasonal rotation. Should we:\n\n[poll name=poll6 type=regular results=always chartType=bar]\n* Maintain season duration at 3 months\n* Increase season duration to 4 months\n* Increase season duration to 5 months\n* Increase season duration to 6 months\n[/poll]\n\n### Budget\nSeason 1 allocated 11M BANK while Season 2 increased spending to 20.5M BANK, and in Season 3 we increased spending to 30M BANK For reference, the treasury currently holds 182M BANK with an additional 33M expected to vest during Season 4.\n\n[poll name=poll7 type=regular results=always chartType=bar]\n* Increase Seasonal Spending\n* Decrease Seasonal Spending\n* Same Seasonal Spending as Season 3\n[/poll]\n\nIn the past, a capped budget constrained a lot of projects and guilds. In Season 3 we opened the option for a flexible budget following all project & guild submissions. By flexible budget, we mean we will accommodate all guild and project budgets (within reason) and add a Grants Committee + DAO-wide Coordinape.\n\nThere is no current framework for capping funding for flexible budgets. There has been some discussion around increasing accountability for budget allocations in Season 4, which would help ensure guilds and projects meet their KPIs before accessing additional funding.\n\nWith that, here are the options:\n[poll name=poll8 type=regular results=always chartType=bar]\n* Maintain flexible budget without changing accountability constraints\n* Maintain flexible budget and increase accountability constraints\n* Transition back to fixed budget\n[/poll]\n\n**Funding Requirements**\n\nCurrently, projects and guild budgets are evaluated largely on the proposal. There has been some discussion recently that more KPIs, milestones, value alignment mechanisms and reporting requirements should be implemented as part of funding requirements. Should we:\n\n[poll name=poll9 type=regular results=always chartType=bar]\n* Keep funding requirements the same\n* Encourage use of KPIs, milestones, and reporting for all funding\n* Encourage use of KPIs, milestones, and reporting for large amounts only (>100,000 BANK)\n[/poll]\n\n**Simplifying the Funding Process**\n\nThere can be a lot of overhead in order to access funding, where proposal development can take weeks for larger projects and guilds. There has been some discussion around reducing proposal requirements and the overhead involved for funding requests. Should we:\n\n[poll name=poll10 type=regular results=always chartType=bar]\n* Maintain current funding requirements\n* Reduce proposal requirements and increase accountability (e.g. KPIs, milestones, reporting)\n* Reduce proposal requirements without increasing accountability\n[/poll]\n\n**Grants Committee**\n\nThe Grants Committee has distributed over 45% of its budget for S3. It's worth noting that most projects have been funded and will qualify for S4 direct funding. In S4, we should:\n\n[poll name=poll11 type=regular results=always chartType=bar]\n* Increase Grants Committee Funding (>7M BANK)\n* Decrease Grants Committee Funding (<7M BANK)\n* Keep Grants Committee Funding Unchanged (7M BANK)\n[/poll]\n\nIt has been proposed that the Grants Committee impose greater accountability requirements for the projects it funds. This may increase the overhead of projects that receive funding through the Grants Committee, but it should help ensure projects achieve their goals and DAO funding is well spent. With that in mind:\n\n[poll name=poll12 type=regular results=always chartType=bar]\n* Increase accountability requirements for projects funded through the Grants Committee\n* Maintain current accountability requirements for projects funded through the Grants Committee\n* Decrease accountability requirements for projects funded through the Grants Committee\n[/poll]\n\n**Guild Funding**\n\nSeason 3 distributed 8M BANK to the 12 guilds in Bankless DAO. You can get a [full breakdown](https://snapshot.org/#/banklessvault.eth/proposal/0xe3f54fb37453af90984c4c41256afde75b92b8383acdcb9a7f467574e0cccb8a) of the funding distribution here. In Season 4, we should:\n\n[poll name=poll13 type=regular results=always chartType=bar]\n* Increase Guild Funding\n* Keep Guild Funding Unchanged\n* Decrease Guild Funding\n* Transition to Flexible Funding\n[/poll]\n\n**Project Funding**\n\nSeason 3 distributed 11M BANK to the 17 projects in Bankless DAO. You can get a [full breakdown](https://snapshot.org/#/banklessvault.eth/proposal/0xe3f54fb37453af90984c4c41256afde75b92b8383acdcb9a7f467574e0cccb8a) of the funding distribution here. In Season 4, we should:\n\n[poll name=poll14 type=regular results=always chartType=bar]\n* Increase Project Funding\n* Keep Project Funding Unchanged\n* Decrease Project Funding\n* Transition to Flexible Project Funding\n[/poll]\n\n**Contributor Rewards**\n\nSeason 2 expanded the Contributor Rewards to multiple rounds, including monthly rounds for Contributors, Level 1s, and recent Guest Passes. In total, 3.5M BANK was distributed via this method. Season 3 increased contributor rewards further, with 4M BANK distributed via the same methods.\n\nIn Season 4, we should:\n\n[poll name=poll15 type=regular results=always chartType=bar]\n* Increase Contributor Rewards\n* Decrease Contributor Rewards\n* Keep Contributor Rewards Unchanged\n[/poll]\n\n**Coordinape Rounds**\n\nFollow-up on the frequency of the Coordinape rounds: In Season 3 we voted to maintain monthly Coordinape rounds. In Season 4, we should:\n\n[poll name=poll16 type=regular results=always chartType=bar]\n* Continue Monthly Rounds\n* Discontinue Monthly Rounds and Revert to Seasonal Rounds\n[/poll]\n\n**Hourly Compensation Guideline**\n\nSeasons 1 through 3 featured the hourly rate guideline at 1,000 BANK per hour. There have been ongoing discussions around changing this figure. These are important considerations for contribution to the DAO when BANK has a lower fiat value in a bear market, as compared to when BANK has high value in a bull market. Keeping in mind that this is a guideline and can be adjusted throughout the season, the rate guideline for contributors should fall at:\n\n[poll name=poll17 type=regular results=always chartType=bar]\n* 1250 BANK/hour\n* 1000 BANK/hour\n* 750 BANK/hour\n* 500 BANK/hour\n[/poll]\n\nFor more context, see the[ compensation working group post](https://forum.bankless.community/t/compensation-at-banklessdao/2272).\n\nPlease keep in mind that none of these poll results are final, they simply represent the DAO's sentiment as we build out the Season 4 spec, which will go through its own independent governance process.",
