    "cooked": "<p>Thanks to everyone for your thoughtful comments on this proposal. To start I\u2019d like to drive home the fact that, while I\u2019m named on this proposal, I am not a beneficiary of any potential grant funding. I\u2019ve been asked by Wildfire DAO to co-host AMAs, and a portion of the sponsorship money would be directed towards me as reimbursement for my efforts. I\u2019m grateful to Wildfire DAO for including me, but would also note that my participation here is not exclusive. I believe the task of presenting should be open to others who are willing and capable. This should be done by invite from the project champions, but I can think of a number of other fantastic bDAO members who would make great hosts.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve always been a proponent of offering other bDAO members the opportunity to host. Originally this was because AMAs weren\u2019t monitized and I couldn\u2019t justify the time spent researching projects with zero compensation. Once we build in a funding mechanism, it was because I want other members to have the opportunity to benefit financially.</p>\n<p>With that said, there are a few things to cover in this proposal:</p>\n<p>BanklessDAO is a <em><strong>MEDIA</strong></em> DAO, and we are severely lacking in our media production. Podcasts have started taking off, and are getting to the point of profitability, but our video production has been neglected. Many discussions have been had, both within the AMA work stream group and within AV guild, about how we can make a splash on YouTube, but nothing has yet come out of them. It seems to boil down to the fact that it\u2019s nobody\u2019s job, so nobody is doing it.</p>\n<p>There should be an incentive for pushing this initiative forward, so a BANK grant isn\u2019t out of the ordinary. Is the ask of $25k (previously $50k) a reasonable cost? With current market prices, it seems like a big ask. BANK is near all-time lows, so it doesn\u2019t translate well to any dollar amount. Had this proposal surfaced in December it would have been for 1/10th the amount of BANK. That would have seemed reasonable given the potential upside. There may be some middle ground that can be explored in terms of KPI based funding release, and I know that Walshy and Jaris are open to discussing the best way forward with Grants Committee.</p>\n<p>Potential upside is a huge variable here. We need to set our sights high on sponsorship deals. We have the potential to generate thousands of views with our videos, but we need to be generating consistent and quality content. We\u2019re stuck in a negative loop. Our YouTube doesn\u2019t get enough views so partners are reluctant to pay top tier prices for sponsorships. In the current state of play, we need to increase views before sponsors will pay more.</p>\n<p>Interviews with popular guests will be a great way to kickstart the positive flywheel effect. In turn it will increase exposure to other future content streams. Therefore it won\u2019t only generate revenue directly, but also indirectly through other YouTube initiatives. We can still have other YouTube content work streams, and I\u2019m in discussions with other DAO members to generate just that. Additionally we can use these AMAs to plug internal projects like other podcasts, Bankless Academy, Fight Club, Bankless Card, newsletters, etc. etc. Overall we will have greater reach and faster growth.</p>\n<p>Couldn\u2019t we just do this directly within BanklessDAO and not include Wildfire DAO?</p>\n<p>Yes, but they do bring high profile guests, and they were the first to bring a proposal of this kind. If this initiative had started within bDAO, it would have likely followed previous initiatives meaning 10% of sponsorship fees to the DAO, and 10% to the relevant guild (most likely AV). The remaining 80% would have gone to contributors. This initiative is actually generous in those terms\u2026 there\u2019s a smaller percentage going to the contributors. It just so happens the contributors are from Wildfire DAO.</p>\n<p>Overall I\u2019m in favour of this proposal. I would have taken more of a boot-strapped approach, but we\u2019ve had over a year to get some YouTube streams off the ground and nobody has done it. We\u2019re missing out on a major opportunity, and this proposal aims to put us on the path to achieving our media DAO potential.</p>\n<p>Now it\u2019s just down to GC to determine what that is worth.</p>",
