The ThriveCoin team has tested numerous community engagement tools over the years and has created ThriveCoin to address long-standing needs.</p>\n<p>ThriveCoin provides a platform that will:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Auto-clarify opportunities to engage</li>\n<li>Auto-verify contributions</li>\n<li>Auto-distribute rewards</li>\n<li>Auto-record meaningful activities</li>\n<li>Auto-surface culture insights</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Auto-clarification of opportunities to engage can encourage more contributions, ease onboarding to contributing with us, and reinforce our framework for how we value various types of contributions.</p>\n<p>Auto-verification of contributions allows us to provide a significantly simpler workflow for contributors and less management for admins. (A manual verification option is also available as needed.)</p>\n<p>Auto-distribution of rewards allows us to reward not just gratitude for contributions (as Coordinape does) but also directly reward the contributions themselves.</p>\n<p>Rewarded activities are auto-recorded on-chain, providing a centralized contribution record, including guild status and contributor roles.</p>\n<p>Finally, recorded activities are periodically auto-analyzed to surface insights and publicly available in an easy-to-review way that eases self-analysis.</p>\n<p>Most importantly, the platform can be used in tandem with our existing tools, such as Discord, Discourse, and Snapshot, as well as other critical platforms for contribution and contribution recognition such as Medium and Coordinape.</p>\n<p>With no required costs and potential substantial community benefit, we believe this proposal is low risk and high reward.</p>\n<h1>\n<a name=\"mission-values-alignment-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#mission-values-alignment-2\"></a>MISSION &amp; VALUES ALIGNMENT</h1>\n<p>This proposal seeks to sustain the motivation for the contributors that power bDAO and incentivize more future contributions.</p>\n<p>This proposal supports our values in the following way:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Education - ThriveCoin can be used directly to provide user-friendly onramps for people to discover Defi by clarifying the learning and engagement opportunities and incentivizing newcomers to learn and engage with Defi by providing feedback about their learning progress and crypto rewards.</li>\n<li>Integrity - If adopted, this would allow key contributor activities \u2013 including participation in a guild and levels \u2013 to be easily tracked on the blockchain and navigated via a user-friendly interface.

Contributors who wish to participate will be able to connect their wallet to the ThriveCoin platform and will get rewarded in $THRIVE for:\n\n1. bDAO Snapshot contributions\n2. bDAO Discord activity\n3. bDAO Twitter engagement\n\nMore networks and ways to earn are being added on an ongoing basis. bDAO will fully control if and how those network contributions are configured.\n\nRemuneration can be changed to $BANK at any time in the future. There is no cost for this proposal. ThriveCoin will provide all required setup.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nThriveCoin is providing what DAOs have been talking about for a long time but have been unable to execute. That is rewarding DAO community members for cross-network activity and engagement.\n\nMaintaining and growing an active, highly engaged community is essential to the success of bDAO. The ThriveCoin team has tested numerous community engagement tools over the years and has created ThriveCoin to address long-standing needs.\n\nThriveCoin provides a platform that will:\n\n* Auto-clarify opportunities to engage\n* Auto-verify contributions\n* Auto-distribute rewards\n* Auto-record meaningful activities\n* Auto-surface culture insights\n\nAuto-clarification of opportunities to engage can encourage more contributions, ease onboarding to contributing with us, and reinforce our framework for how we value various types of contributions.\n\nAuto-verification of contributions allows us to provide a significantly simpler workflow for contributors and less management for admins. (A manual verification option is also available as needed.)\n\nAuto-distribution of rewards allows us to reward not just gratitude for contributions (as Coordinape does) but also directly reward the contributions themselves.\n\nRewarded activities are auto-recorded on-chain, providing a centralized contribution record, including guild status and contributor roles.\n\nFinally, recorded activities are periodically auto-analyzed to surface insights and publicly available in an easy-to-review way that eases self-analysis.\n\nMost importantly, the platform can be used in tandem with our existing tools, such as Discord, Discourse, and Snapshot, as well as other critical platforms for contribution and contribution recognition such as Medium and Coordinape.\n\nWith no required costs and potential substantial community benefit, we believe this proposal is low risk and high reward.\n\n# MISSION & VALUES ALIGNMENT\n\nThis proposal seeks to sustain the motivation for the contributors that power bDAO and incentivize more future contributions.\n\nThis proposal supports our values in the following way:\n\n* Education - ThriveCoin can be used directly to provide user-friendly onramps for people to discover Defi by clarifying the learning and engagement opportunities and incentivizing newcomers to learn and engage with Defi by providing feedback about their learning progress and crypto rewards.\n* Integrity - If adopted, this would allow key contributor activities \u2013 including participation in a guild and levels \u2013 to be easily tracked on the blockchain and navigated via a user-friendly interface. This makes contributions and related reward distribution more transparent, trustworthy, and financially auditable.\n* Decentralized governance - If this proposal is adopted, key activities that support decentralized governance \u2013 discussions on Discord; debates on Discourse; voting on Snapshot; etc. \u2013 can be more transparently seen, acknowledged, and incentivized\n* Culture - If adopted, this proposal would provide additional clarity to BanklessDAO\u2019s incentives system, which is built to support a bias toward risk and action. Further, it provides a space to self-organize by providing auto-validation of contributions and encourages moving quickly from idea to action by immediately auto-distributing rewards to auto-validated contributors.\n\n# SPECIFICATION\n\nFrom an administrative perspective, piloting the platform requires one or more points of contact who can make authoritative decisions about:\n\n* The content of a public-facing Bankless DAO \u201cCommunity\u201d page on the ThriveCoin platform\n* The content of the contribution opportunities we want to recognize and reward, including any customizations to the default name, description, number of completions per user, and reward amounts for those opportunities\n* Additionally, providing read-access to any non-public networks where contributions are happening that we want to recognize\n\nFrom a contributor perspective, all that is required to get value out of the ThriveCoin platform is to connect a wallet that\u2019s made BanklessDAO contributions before and verify your identity on any other platforms you\u2019ve used to make contributions (e.g. Discord)\n\nOnce connected/verified, all past and future contributions toward BanklessDAO and other recognized DAOs on ThriveCoin will be automatically recorded on the Mumbai network, Polygon chain, and rewarded with ThriveCoin ($THRIVE) tokens.\n\nRewards are auto-distributed using an [open-source smart contract](https://github.com/ThriveCoin/thc-smart-contracts-sol) that has been audited by Kraken \u2013 a top smart contract auditing firm \u2013 and received a perfect score on its audit.

Similarly, any additional costs (including gas/chain transaction fees and platform fees) will also be covered by ThriveCoin.\n* If funding is required at a later date, a new proposal will be submitted.\n* No rewards are needed for squad members.\n\n# BRAND USAGE\n\n* BanklessDAO will have a public \u201cCommunity\u201d and \u201cMission\u201d page on the ThriveCoin web app. All content on this page can be freely edited by appointed BanklessDAO members.\n  * A sample \u201cCommunity\u201d page can be seen here: https://app.thrivecoin.com/communities/16\n  * \u201cMission\u201d pages are gamified versions of Community pages\n\n# SUCCESS METRICS OR KPIS\n\nThe project should result in increased DAO contributions and increased satisfaction for DAO rewards and recognition.

Appoint a point of contact team\n\n  * Proposed bDAO x ThriveCoin squad: 0xJustice + Senad + 0xBear\n  * Responsible for coordination with ThriveCoin about requests (such as updates to listing contribution opportunities) and receiving product/feature updates\n    * This point of contact will have the ability to self-update BanklessDAO\u2019s community page on the ThriveCoin web app, as well as appoint additional administrators\n  * Update the BanklessDAO Community page on the ThriveCoin web app if/as needed\n\n2. Set up and finalize initial contribution opportunities\n\n  * Request any updates to the starting set of contribution opportunities (these are opportunities whose completion is publicly visible)\n  * Provide access to the Integromat Discord bot to join BanklessDAO\u2019s Discord \u2013 this will enable ThriveCoin to recognize Discord opportunities \u2013 and to other key platforms\n  * Coordinate with ThriveCoin to finalize the set of contribution opportunities and their conditions\n\n3. Announce the initiative and encourage participation\n\n  * Use the appropriate channel(s) to notify that any voters on the BanklessDAO Snapshot space (past and future) can be automatically rewarded for their contributions if they connect their wallet to ThriveCoin\n  * Publicly post in the appropriate channel(s) when key changes or new opportunities occur\n\n# SQUAD BACKGROUND\n\nbDAO ThriveCoin Squad\n\n* 0xJustice - GSE. bDAO Constitution Lead.
