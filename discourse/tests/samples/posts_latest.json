To start I\u2019d like to drive home the fact that, while I\u2019m named on this proposal, I am not a beneficiary of any potential grant funding. I\u2019ve been asked by Wildfire DAO to co-host AMAs, and a portion of the sponsorship money would be directed towards me as reimbursement for my efforts. I\u2019m grateful to Wildfire DAO for including me, but would also note that my participation here is not exclusive. I believe the task of presenting should be open to others who are willing and capable. This should be done by invite from the project champions, but I can think of a number of other fantastic bDAO members who would make great hosts.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve always been a proponent of offering other bDAO members the opportunity to host. Originally this was because AMAs weren\u2019t monitized and I couldn\u2019t justify the time spent researching projects with zero compensation. Once we build in a funding mechanism, it was because I want other members to have the opportunity to benefit financially.</p>\n<p>With that said, there are a few things to cover in this proposal:</p>\n<p>BanklessDAO is a <em><strong>MEDIA</strong></em> DAO, and we are severely lacking in our media production. Podcasts have started taking off, and are getting to the point of profitability, but our video production has been neglected. Many discussions have been had, both within the AMA work stream group and within AV guild, about how we can make a splash on YouTube, but nothing has yet come out of them. It seems to boil down to the fact that it\u2019s nobody\u2019s job, so nobody is doing it.</p>\n<p>There should be an incentive for pushing this initiative forward, so a BANK grant isn\u2019t out of the ordinary. Is the ask of $25k (previously $50k) a reasonable cost? With current market prices, it seems like a big ask. BANK is near all-time lows, so it doesn\u2019t translate well to any dollar amount. Had this proposal surfaced in December it would have been for 1/10th the amount of BANK. That would have seemed reasonable given the potential upside. There may be some middle ground that can be explored in terms of KPI based funding release, and I know that Walshy and Jaris are open to discussing the best way forward with Grants Committee.</p>\n<p>Potential upside is a huge variable here. We need to set our sights high on sponsorship deals. We have the potential to generate thousands of views with our videos, but we need to be generating consistent and quality content. We\u2019re stuck in a negative loop. Our YouTube doesn\u2019t get enough views so partners are reluctant to pay top tier prices for sponsorships. In the current state of play, we need to increase views before sponsors will pay more.</p>\n<p>Interviews with popular guests will be a great way to kickstart the positive flywheel effect. In turn it will increase exposure to other future content streams. Therefore it won\u2019t only generate revenue directly, but also indirectly through other YouTube initiatives. We can still have other YouTube content work streams, and I\u2019m in discussions with other DAO members to generate just that. Additionally we can use these AMAs to plug internal projects like other podcasts, Bankless Academy, Fight Club, Bankless Card, newsletters, etc. etc. Overall we will have greater reach and faster growth.</p>\n<p>Couldn\u2019t we just do this directly within BanklessDAO and not include Wildfire DAO?</p>\n<p>Yes, but they do bring high profile guests, and they were the first to bring a proposal of this kind. If this initiative had started within bDAO, it would have likely followed previous initiatives meaning 10% of sponsorship fees to the DAO, and 10% to the relevant guild (most likely AV). The remaining 80% would have gone to contributors. This initiative is actually generous in those terms\u2026 there\u2019s a smaller percentage going to the contributors.

Consistency is crucial to be in good standings with the YouTube algorithm, and we will use keywords effectively in order to expand our reach outside of the BanklessDAO community.</p>\n<p><a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/nfthinker\">@NFThinker</a> and I have the second most viewed video on on the BanklessDAO YouTube channel, which was the AMA with the Idols. However, not much marketing went into promoting the event. To ensure that we consistently hit metrics that are ideal, e.g. 100 likes on twitter (minimum) for each promotional tweet, and 1,000 views per week on YouTube, which is our goal, we have to create the promotional content as well as prepare for the event, host the event, and edit the videos.

            "raw": "I would like to highlight our plan to boost the engagement metrics for the bDAO YouTube and Twitter, which will benefit every content creator in our community.\n\nOur AMA series will release episodes on YouTube at a weekly cadence, and promoted on twitter while leading up to the event, and after the video has been posted. Consistency is crucial to be in good standings with the YouTube algorithm, and we will use keywords effectively in order to expand our reach outside of the BanklessDAO community.\n\n @NFThinker and I have the second most viewed video on on the BanklessDAO YouTube channel, which was the AMA with the Idols. However, not much marketing went into promoting the event. To ensure that we consistently hit metrics that are ideal, e.g. 100 likes on twitter (minimum) for each promotional tweet, and 1,000 views per week on YouTube, which is our goal, we have to create the promotional content as well as prepare for the event, host the event, and edit the videos. To reach our goals for social engagement, we will utilize keyword research/SEO methods, this will help us create an attractive title that users will click on as opposed to \"BanklessDAO AMA with ....\" \n\nAlthough, BanklessDAO has over 50,000 followers on Twitter, our engagement rate is far below 1%.

            "cooked": "<p>Hello - great comments so far, thank you everyone for all of your honest feedback. There\u2019s a lot of really great points that were honest and direct - ones that have been received and digested on.</p>\n<p>TLDR: we\u2019ve reevaluated and are happy to reduce our ask by 50%. Based on current feedback, we\u2019d ask the revenue split for sponsors to be adjusted to 30% bDAO, 60% wfDAO, 10% NFThinker (as long as he is hosting).</p>\n<p>bDAO is special to me because even though I haven\u2019t been a contributor since early Q2 of this year - it was my first DAO and helped formed my core foundations of what a DAO is and what type of a person works for DAOs. In fact, I believed so strongly in this model being the next step for work that I joined Opolis, stood up an LLC, and went full time DAOs. None of that would\u2019ve been possible if it weren\u2019t for Ryan Sean Adams, David Hoffman, and BanklessDAO. Thank you.</p>\n<p>As many of you know - 0xLucas is a founder of WildfireDAO as well as bDAO. When we spoke to Lucas about the state of bDAO - he confided in us, the Creator Economy Working Group of wfDAO, that part of the original vision of bDAO was to match the signal and respect level of HQ through education and efficient onboarding - as well as to compliment HQ\u2019s efforts by providing a place to foster a vibrant and resilient community. And while great strides have been made and bDAO has inarguably created the largest DAO in the ecosystem, he also acknowledged that success has also brought it\u2019s own problems.</p>\n<p>The problem? bDAO needs revenue to survive. Token down.</p>\n<p>Revenue generating DAO = DAO that can fund salaries = happy/productive members = DAO that produces in the bear market = perception of increased value to interested investors = price goes up = happier DAO members = more successful projects = frens = successful DAO</p>\n<p>The issue? Not enough projects are contributing to the treasury. Too many mouths to feed. Hyperinflation of BANK token in down markets. 5% of people carrying 95% of the load. Rough communication between guilds. Expensive projects with no clear ROI. Not enough retention. Constant onboarding.</p>\n<p>Some of these are problems I faced directly back in February when I brought the NFT project \u2018The Idols\u2019 to bDAO as a client. It wasn\u2019t a clean process and allowed me to observe areas that needed improvement.</p>\n<p>We don\u2019t think this AMA project alone will solve this, but we hope to inspire more of you to develop efficient processes/revenue opportunities to aid bDAO. Jaris has a personal goal of improving engagement with bDAO socials and with 5 rotating sponsors a month - the annual ROI for the treasury is $180,000 if the split is 30% bdAO 60% wfDAO 10% NFThinker.</p>\n<p>This is a great time to note: NFThinker isn\u2019t in wfDAO but is the current host of the AMAs along with Jaris. Our intent was never to just barge in and change the format or hosts and switch everything up. Quite the opposite! I designed the original AMA business model with Jaris and NFThinker - and we all agree that we want to keep the show format the same.</p>\n<p>As long as he is hosting AMAs we would like for him to be compensated for doing so. He is not receiving any BANK from the grant, only receiving funds from the sponsors.</p>\n<p>The $50,000 in BANK ask was calculated in a very simple way, and not in a malicious manner. The conversation was literally, okay we charge $5k now - let\u2019s multiply by 11 (amount of shows) and then round down so the number is clean.</p>\n<p>Our other grants with DAOs don\u2019t really take the token quantity into consideration, but rather $$$ per job.</p>\n<p>One thing we didn\u2019t take into account was how many tokens the original ask is in BANK. Especially compared to where we were in December, we can understand why that amount seems egregious.</p>\n<p>Another thing we didn\u2019t take into account was that none of you understand how we structured the AMA model back in February and how the contributors get paid in the current model. This was our fault.</p>\n<p>How it works is projects pay $5k to do an AMA with bDAO. From that $5000, 50% went to the hosts, 10-20% to the bDAO treasury, 10-20% went to the A/V crew (depending on how many contributors were needed), and 10% finders fee for whoever scouted the project.</p>\n<p>The small, easy to miss detail is that the 11 projects we\u2019ve proposed to work with in the grant WON\u2019T be paying for an AMA, and instead we are offering to do it for free.</p>\n<p>The problem then becomes that we, the content creators, don\u2019t have a source of compensation.<br>\nHence, the idea with the sponsors is a simple one - reoccuring revenue.</p>\n<p>With this model - ARR now exists for both DAOs, an additional grant is never needed for wfDAO and the AMA project becomes self-sustaining provided there are enough projects/DAOs/start-ups/etc that are interested in being a sponsor.</p>\n<p>To state it again: if successful, we will only need one grant. Not a seasonal one.</p>\n<p>Links asked about lead count and considers it a risk.</p>\n<p>As we stated in the proposal, we haven\u2019t begun our efforts here yet - but we are more than incentivized to do so via the split - and frankly the sponsors find bDAO already without effort.

            "raw": "Hello - great comments so far, thank you everyone for all of your honest feedback. There's a lot of really great points that were honest and direct - ones that have been received and digested on. \n\nTLDR: we've reevaluated and are happy to reduce our ask by 50%. Based on current feedback, we'd ask the revenue split for sponsors to be adjusted to 30% bDAO, 60% wfDAO, 10% NFThinker (as long as he is hosting).\n\nbDAO is special to me because even though I haven't been a contributor since early Q2 of this year - it was my first DAO and helped formed my core foundations of what a DAO is and what type of a person works for DAOs. In fact, I believed so strongly in this model being the next step for work that I joined Opolis, stood up an LLC, and went full time DAOs. None of that would've been possible if it weren't for Ryan Sean Adams, David Hoffman, and BanklessDAO. Thank you.\n\nAs many of you know - 0xLucas is a founder of WildfireDAO as well as bDAO. When we spoke to Lucas about the state of bDAO - he confided in us, the Creator Economy Working Group of wfDAO, that part of the original vision of bDAO was to match the signal and respect level of HQ through education and efficient onboarding - as well as to compliment HQ's efforts by providing a place to foster a vibrant and resilient community. And while great strides have been made and bDAO has inarguably created the largest DAO in the ecosystem, he also acknowledged that success has also brought it's own problems.\n\nThe problem? bDAO needs revenue to survive. Token down.\n\nRevenue generating DAO = DAO that can fund salaries = happy/productive members = DAO that produces in the bear market = perception of increased value to interested investors = price goes up = happier DAO members = more successful projects = frens = successful DAO\n\nThe issue? Not enough projects are contributing to the treasury. Too many mouths to feed. Hyperinflation of BANK token in down markets. 5% of people carrying 95% of the load. Rough communication between guilds. Expensive projects with no clear ROI. Not enough retention. Constant onboarding.\n\nSome of these are problems I faced directly back in February when I brought the NFT project 'The Idols' to bDAO as a client. It wasn't a clean process and allowed me to observe areas that needed improvement. \n\nWe don't think this AMA project alone will solve this, but we hope to inspire more of you to develop efficient processes/revenue opportunities to aid bDAO. Jaris has a personal goal of improving engagement with bDAO socials and with 5 rotating sponsors a month - the annual ROI for the treasury is $180,000 if the split is 30% bdAO 60% wfDAO 10% NFThinker. \n\nThis is a great time to note: NFThinker isn't in wfDAO but is the current host of the AMAs along with Jaris. Our intent was never to just barge in and change the format or hosts and switch everything up. Quite the opposite! I designed the original AMA business model with Jaris and NFThinker - and we all agree that we want to keep the show format the same. \n\nAs long as he is hosting AMAs we would like for him to be compensated for doing so. He is not receiving any BANK from the grant, only receiving funds from the sponsors.\n\nThe $50,000 in BANK ask was calculated in a very simple way, and not in a malicious manner. The conversation was literally, okay we charge $5k now - let's multiply by 11 (amount of shows) and then round down so the number is clean.   \n\nOur other grants with DAOs don't really take the token quantity into consideration, but rather $$$ per job.\n\nOne thing we didn't take into account was how many tokens the original ask is in BANK. Especially compared to where we were in December, we can understand why that amount seems egregious. \n\nAnother thing we didn't take into account was that none of you understand how we structured the AMA model back in February and how the contributors get paid in the current model. This was our fault.\n\nHow it works is projects pay $5k to do an AMA with bDAO. From that $5000, 50% went to the hosts, 10-20% to the bDAO treasury, 10-20% went to the A/V crew (depending on how many contributors were needed), and 10% finders fee for whoever scouted the project.\n\nThe small, easy to miss detail is that the 11 projects we've proposed to work with in the grant WON'T be paying for an AMA, and instead we are offering to do it for free. \n\nThe problem then becomes that we, the content creators, don't have a source of compensation.\nHence, the idea with the sponsors is a simple one - reoccuring revenue.\n\nWith this model - ARR now exists for both DAOs, an additional grant is never needed for wfDAO and the AMA project becomes self-sustaining provided there are enough projects/DAOs/start-ups/etc that are interested in being a sponsor. \n\nTo state it again: if successful, we will only need one grant. Not a seasonal one.\n\nLinks asked about lead count and considers it a risk.\n\nAs we stated in the proposal, we haven't begun our efforts here yet - but we are more than incentivized to do so via the split - and frankly the sponsors find bDAO already without effort. There is no shortage of projects looking to talk to bDAO. \n\nBeyond the IB leads, each of us has an unique network we will utilize to procure sponsors. And to add a cherry, Jaris reported to me earlier that we already have an interested sponsor looking to discuss details. We have a very wide network we can utilize here.\n\nThere was a comment that bDAO shoulders all of the risk - but bDAO is in trouble and has asked us for our help. While I understand that it seems like wfDAO is shouldering zero risk, it's our time and reputation on the line. It's our faces being used. It's our concept.  And we were asked to help - assigned a task if you will. \n\nConsidering most projects only contribute 10% to the DAO treasury - we feel like the 30% share for bDAO will make up for this and balance out the risk.\n\nSO - given the above, we've reevaluated and are happy to reduce our ask by 50% and adjust the revenue split for sponsors to 30% bDAO, 60% wfDAO, 10% NFThinker. We hope our intentions are made more clear, and I'm happy to answer any questions as best I can.",

The research will involve contribution mainly from members of the legal guild, as well as some services from designers and editors. The total ask to execute this project is 99,999 BANK and the final deliverable is a report that can be minted by NomadPunk NFT holders.</p>\n<p><strong>BACKGROUND</strong></p>\n<p>The Crypto Nomad research project was born straight out of the idea of being a sovereign individual. Self-sovereignty is a concept that resonates with many people in the Bankless community and we thought it would be a great idea to empower Metaverse netizens with the right knowledge to shape their journey into self-sovereignty.</p>\n<p>Another reason is the emergence of unfriendly crypto laws in many jurisdictions which make it difficult for the contributors of bDAO to fully commit themselves to the \u2018DAOLife\u2019. This research will offer options to those individuals to seek other solutions to Metaverse problems.</p>\n<p><strong>MISSION &amp; VALUES ALIGNMENT</strong></p>\n<p>In order to fully embrace the mission and values of the Bankless movement, it is important that members have the ability to work and live in fiscally favourable jurisdictions. As the Metaverse further transforms ways in which people coordinate, we take this opportunity to better the lives of all those who seek a sovereign lifestyle, all those who want to use jurisdictional arbitrage to their advantage, or those who simply want to enjoy \u2018DAO-life\u2019 without interference from nation-state laws.</p>\n<p>With this research, we aim to empower Crypto Nomads, aspiring Crypto Nomads with the ability to choose the best jurisdiction to structure their affairs and possibly offer non-legal advice to members and non-members as a consultancy service in the future.</p>\n<p><strong>SPECIFICATION</strong></p>\n<p>In the course of S5, a team of legal experts will research and present a report on the top jurisdictions for Crypto Nomads. The report will include a short analysis of the Pros and Cons of each jurisdiction that is deemed worthy, and present the best destinations for people with different needs, in a generic setting along with a step-by-step guide on how one can establish themselves in this new nomad friendly jurisdiction. To conclude, the report will highlight the main steps one needs to take to change jurisdictions and point them to the bDAO Legal guild for further queries.</p>\n<p>We will additionally collaborate with the founders of DAOpunkz NFT project as well as the Metaversal Revenue Service(MRS) to produce NFTs which offer access to this document. The proceeds from this sales will be split between the artists, bDAO, MRS and the contributors of this project. The Digital Nomad guide will be clubbed with the updated Global Taxation Guide and the access to these two guides will be paired with the NFTs.</p>\n<p>To execute this a project manager will create a task list for collaborators to work on specific action items. The expected flow is as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Working Groups identify top jurisdictions in each of these regions: Americas( including Caribbean), Europe, Africa and the Middle East, Asia and Oceania.</li>\n<li>Reach out to relevant partners in the web3 verse for collaboration.</li>\n<li>Identify top (3 or 5) jurisdictions based on use cases, statistics, and deep dive into specific solutions for each use case.</li>\n<li>Compile everything into a report</li>\n<li>Work with artists and developers to build and market an attractive landing page and minting contract.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS</strong></p>\n<p>The project involves collaboration between a Project Manager and Contributors:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Initial Research and Template setting: 10000 BANK</li>\n<li>Analysis of 5 specific jurisdictions/cases: 50000 BANK @ 10000 BANK each</li>\n<li>Final Report Compilation: 10000 BANK (divided between all those that help out)</li>\n<li>Project Managers: 9999 BANK</li>\n<li>Tokenization/marketing/design 20000 BANK</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Total costs: 99,999 BANK</p>\n<p><strong>NEXT STEPS</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Based on the feedback from the first mint, we will proceed to plan V2 of the report with additional jurisdictions or update the existing ones</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>This report can in no way be constituted as legal advice and all content generated within it will be for general informational purposes only.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>What do you think about this proposal?</strong></p>\n<div class=\"poll\" data-poll-status=\"open\" data-poll-results=\"always\" data-poll-charttype=\"bar\" data-poll-type=\"regular\" data-poll-name=\"poll\">\n<div>\n<div class=\"poll-container\">\n<ul>\n<li data-poll-option-id=\"69ebd93e14c8533aabc68b6f4bd442bd\">Yay!

            "raw": "Author: jengajojo\n\nSquad: jengajojo, lion917, Eagle, teresacd\n\n**SUMMARY**\n\nThe Legal guild would like to spin up a research project aimed at Crypto DAO Nomads/Wannabe Digital Nomads. The research will involve contribution mainly from members of the legal guild, as well as some services from designers and editors. The total ask to execute this project is 99,999 BANK and the final deliverable is a report that can be minted by NomadPunk NFT holders.\n\n**BACKGROUND**\n\nThe Crypto Nomad research project was born straight out of the idea of being a sovereign individual. Self-sovereignty is a concept that resonates with many people in the Bankless community and we thought it would be a great idea to empower Metaverse netizens with the right knowledge to shape their journey into self-sovereignty.\n\nAnother reason is the emergence of unfriendly crypto laws in many jurisdictions which make it difficult for the contributors of bDAO to fully commit themselves to the \u2018DAOLife\u2019. This research will offer options to those individuals to seek other solutions to Metaverse problems.\n\n**MISSION & VALUES ALIGNMENT**\n\nIn order to fully embrace the mission and values of the Bankless movement, it is important that members have the ability to work and live in fiscally favourable jurisdictions. As the Metaverse further transforms ways in which people coordinate, we take this opportunity to better the lives of all those who seek a sovereign lifestyle, all those who want to use jurisdictional arbitrage to their advantage, or those who simply want to enjoy \u2018DAO-life\u2019 without interference from nation-state laws.\n\nWith this research, we aim to empower Crypto Nomads, aspiring Crypto Nomads with the ability to choose the best jurisdiction to structure their affairs and possibly offer non-legal advice to members and non-members as a consultancy service in the future.\n\n**SPECIFICATION**\n\nIn the course of S5, a team of legal experts will research and present a report on the top jurisdictions for Crypto Nomads. The report will include a short analysis of the Pros and Cons of each jurisdiction that is deemed worthy, and present the best destinations for people with different needs, in a generic setting along with a step-by-step guide on how one can establish themselves in this new nomad friendly jurisdiction. To conclude, the report will highlight the main steps one needs to take to change jurisdictions and point them to the bDAO Legal guild for further queries.\n\nWe will additionally collaborate with the founders of DAOpunkz NFT project as well as the Metaversal Revenue Service(MRS) to produce NFTs which offer access to this document. The proceeds from this sales will be split between the artists, bDAO, MRS and the contributors of this project. The Digital Nomad guide will be clubbed with the updated Global Taxation Guide and the access to these two guides will be paired with the NFTs.\n\nTo execute this a project manager will create a task list for collaborators to work on specific action items. The expected flow is as follows:\n\n1. Working Groups identify top jurisdictions in each of these regions: Americas( including Caribbean), Europe, Africa and the Middle East, Asia and Oceania.\n2. Reach out to relevant partners in the web3 verse for collaboration.\n3. Identify top (3 or 5) jurisdictions based on use cases, statistics, and deep dive into specific solutions for each use case.\n4. Compile everything into a report\n5. Work with artists and developers to build and market an attractive landing page and minting contract.\n\n**FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS**\n\nThe project involves collaboration between a Project Manager and Contributors:\n\n1. Initial Research and Template setting: 10000 BANK\n2. Analysis of 5 specific jurisdictions/cases: 50000 BANK @ 10000 BANK each\n3. Final Report Compilation: 10000 BANK (divided between all those that help out)\n4. Project Managers: 9999 BANK\n5. Tokenization/marketing/design 20000 BANK\n\nTotal costs: 99,999 BANK\n\n**NEXT STEPS**\n\n* Based on the feedback from the first mint, we will proceed to plan V2 of the report with additional jurisdictions or update the existing ones\n\n**Disclaimer:**\n\n* This report can in no way be constituted as legal advice and all content generated within it will be for general informational purposes only.\n\n**What do you think about this proposal?**\n[poll type=regular results=always chartType=bar]\n* Yay! LFG\n* Generally agree with slight modifications (comment below)\n* Nay! This cannot go ahead\n[/poll]",

You\u2019re proposal mentions that it\u2019s 50k to get started, but you refered to it as a seasonal grant. Seasonal to me implies it would be recurring, but I realize this might not have been intended.

Plus 75k $USD per season for 5 sponsors.\n\nTo links' point, charging bDAO for access to the audience. But also as you said to get the project off the ground. As Sid pointed out, the ask is for more than 3 million BANK to get off the ground; in comparison the largest approved ask in our season 5 spec was from bDAO's Podcast Hatchery for 1.6 million.\n\n**In summary, with 5 sponsors per season:**\n**WildFire - Gets 50k $USD in BANK, 75K $USD from sponsors**\n**BanklessDAO - Gets 50k $USD of BANK sell pressure, 10k $USD profit from sponsors**\n\nThat just doesn't check out.\n\nWould double down on Sid's point to take far less of the sponsorship money just for the sake of the sell pressure on BANK.\n\nPs: Had to giggle a bit when I read  \"previously Lead at IreneDAO\", not in a bad way either. Just completely forgot about that whole event and it made me laugh remembering the show it created on Twitter. Good times\n\nEdit: perhaps if the sponsors were required to pay the bDAO portion in BANK that would also help a bit.\n\nFinal edit: walked away and thought about something for a second. You're proposal mentions that it's 50k to get started, but you refered to it as a seasonal grant. Seasonal to me implies it would be recurring, but I realize this might not have been intended. If it's a one time thing that helps a lot, but is still double our largest allowance in the S5 spec.",
